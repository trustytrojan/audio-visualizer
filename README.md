# audio-visualizer
This is my take on an audio visualizer, since I got fed up with software like After Effects lacking customization in their audio spectrums.

## Dependencies
This project depends on `libSDL2pp` and `libSDL2_gfx`, which themselves depend on `libSDL2`.

## Building
Just run `make`. To build and then run: `make run`.
